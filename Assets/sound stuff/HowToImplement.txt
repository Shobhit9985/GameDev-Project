Music
    attach music prefab to game camera 
    in movement controller add the following 

        public GameObject MusicController;
        MusicController musicController;
        musicController = MusicController.GetComponent<MusicController>();

        it is defualt set to play outside ambient
        to play inside ambient use musicController.PlayInsideAmbient()

        to play tense music use  musicController.PlayTense();

        to play triumphant sound effect use musicController.PlayTriumphant(bool outside);
        the var is for what env you are in when calling so it can go back to the correct ambient once it is finished


footAudio

        public GameObject MovementSound;
        MovementSound movementSound; 

        movementSound = MovementSound.GetComponent<MovementSound>();

        where you implement the movement controls, add
        if (!inAir)
            {
                 movementSound.PlayRunGround();
            }
            else if (!inAir)
            {
                movementSound.StopAudio();
            }
        use movementSound.PlayRunWater(); instead if the surface is water

        where you implement jump add
        movementSound.PlayJump();

Ambient Sounds
    place around outside of map of random Sounds
    place throughout env for constant Sounds
    control this choice with the bool random small sounds that is on the gameobject
    if true, will randomly play a different sound every 8 seconds
    if false, will play a constant env sound based off the variable put in loop sound (1-3)
